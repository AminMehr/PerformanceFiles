"STEM Education " ,"Improve Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education by implementing the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan, announced in May 2013, specifically:    	Improve STEM instruction 	Increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM 	Enhance STEM experience of undergraduate students 	Better serve groups historically under-represented in STEM fields 	Design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce 	Build new models for leveraging assets and expertise 	Build and use evidence-based approaches  " ,"Improving STEM education is a priority for the President and this Administration. Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.  A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches.   Members of the Committee on STEM education (CoSTEM) are: Office of Science and Technology Policy National Science Foundation National Aeronautics and Space Administration Department of Agriculture  Department of Commerce  Department of Defense  Department of Education  Department of Energy  Department of Health and Human Services  Department of Homeland Security  Department of the Interior  Department of Transportation  Environmental Protection Agency  Office of Management and Budget Domestic Policy Council Smithsonian Institution " ,"" ,"Jo Handelsman, Associate Director for Science, Office of Science and Technology Policy Joan Ferrini-Mundy, Assistant Director for Education and Human Resources, National Science Foundation " ,"Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services||General Science, Space, and Technology" ,"Mission" ,"Economic Growth: Support innovation, economic growth, and job creation"
