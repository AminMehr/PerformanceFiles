"Smarter IT Delivery " ,"Improve outcomes and customer satisfaction with Federal services through smarter IT delivery and stronger agency accountability for success.  " ,"Innovations in information technology have transformed how customers receive key government services, information, and benefits. Smarter IT delivery will dramatically improve customer satisfaction with federal technology services by strengthening agency accountability and implementing strategies in the following areas:   	Get the best talent working inside government. The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions. 	Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes. 	Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.
